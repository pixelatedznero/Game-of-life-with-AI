# Game of life with AI

Trying to make AI create patterns to do stuff in Conway's game of life

## IMPORTANT

The development of the game of life simulation is beeing discontinued in this repository. An actual libary is beeing developed over at my golpi repository.

## Avalible checks after a simulation

- ### Distance
  get the distance of the furthes alive pixel from the center (not actually the distance only the distance in axes, if you want to add actual distance feel free to contribute)

- ### Pixels per frame
  get the average pixels per frame simulated

- ### Time survived
  amount of frames until the last pixel died
